									<p>Tucker,</p>
									<p>Since you were born you&#39;ve been my best friend. From playing video games of every genre, to skiing and snowboarding, to playing soccer as the last two defenders, we&#39;ve done it all together. You always push me to the edge mentally and physically and even though that drives me crazy sometimes, I love it. On my most carefree days, I still think about pulling up a chair right next to you and grinding through as much Gears of War as possible before we have to do chores. I&#39;m thankful we grew up so close in age to share so many things together and I know I&#39;ll want the same for my children in the future. I know having one of me is tough, and Rachel and I are very much alike, so I&#39;ve always loved how you&#39;ve treated her kindly and with open arms to the family. I couldn&#39;t imagine having a better man by my side the day I marry Rachel. Tucker, will you be my best man?</p>

									<p>TJ,</p>
									<p>When my family moved to Fox Hall before 5th grade, I had no idea I&#39;d be making a new best friend. I can&#39;t recall exactly how we first became friends, but I have to imagine you walked over, rang the doorbell, and we simply proceeded to play some videogames, shoot some hoops, and crush some snacks from my pantry. From there, the rest is history. It seems like time flew through high school and college- playing Spades together in class, playing soccer as co-defenders, watching U.Va basketball games (back when Jeff Jones was there), hanging out at Ocean City, taking our Senior trip cruise, living together two years at U.Va- we&#39;ve done so much together. I&#39;m glad to have shared those and many more memories with you throughout the years. That kind of friendship is not only rare throughout all of time, but especially in today&#39;s world. Aside from your sports statistics, you&#39;re probably one of the most honest and down-to-earth friends that I have and I&#39;ve always appreciated that about you. You hold the special honor of being the first of the bunch to have met my future wife. Even though you&#39;ve already graciously accepted to be our officiant, TJ, will you be my groomsman?</p>

Little did I know, however, that you were the coolest nerd I&#39;ll have ever met. It seems like time flew through middle school and beyond- playing SoF together in class, playing soccer together, hanging out at Ocean City, taking our Senior trip cruise, man week trips- we&#39;ve done so much together. I&#39;m glad to have shared those and many more memories with you throughout the years. That kind of friendship is not only rare throughout all of time, but especially in today&#39;s world. Of all my friends, you always have the ability to make me laugh when situations get too serious and are one of the few people I know who can talk to anyone no matter what mood they&#39;re in. Even if we&#39;re cities apart, I know we will always be friends and I always look forward to when we&#39;re together. Arjun, will you be my groomsman?</p>

									<p>Ajay,</p>
									<p>It&#39;s crazy to think that of all of the &#34;center&#34; friends, I&#39;ve known you the longest. I can still remember back in the elementary school days where we&#39;d get home and play basketball, football, and ride bikes together in the neighborhood. After that, it seems like time flew through high school, college, and beyond- playing years of soccer together, hanging out at Ocean City, U.Va basketball games, man week trips- we&#39;ve done so much together. I&#39;m glad to have shared those and many more memories with you throughout the years. That kind of friendship is not only rare throughout all of time, but especially in today&#39;s world. Of all my friends, you are the kindest and one of the most down-to-earth. Even if we&#39;re cities apart, I know we will always be friends and I always look forward to when we&#39;re together. Ajay, will you be my groomsman?</p>

									<p>Michael,</p>
									<p>It&#39;s crazy to think that we&#39;ve known each other for more than 15 years now, dating back to our elementary school days. It seems like time flew through elementary school and beyond- taking trips out to Ocean City, many games of 21 cup, taking our Senior trip cruise, man week trips- we&#39;ve done so much together. I&#39;m glad to have shared those and many more memories with you throughout the years. That kind of friendship is not only rare throughout all of time, but especially in today&#39;s world. Of all my friends, you are one of the few who never hesitates to call me, or others, out on BS and I&#39;ve always appreciated that about you. Even if we&#39;re cities apart, I know we will always be friends and I always look forward to when we&#39;re together. Michael, will you be my groomsman?</p>
